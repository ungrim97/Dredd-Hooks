Feature: Multiple hook files with a glob

  Background:
    Given I have "dredd-hooks-perl" command installed
    And I have "dredd" command installed
    And a file named "server.rb" with:
      """
      require 'sinatra'

  Scenario:
    Given a file named "hookfile1.pl" with:

      ## Implement before hook writing to standard output text: "It's me, File1"

    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain:
